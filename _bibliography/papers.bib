	title = {Mixed-integer linear programming for scheduling unconventional oil field development},
	abstract={The scheduling of drilling and hydraulic fracturing of wells in an unconventional oil field plays an important role in the profitability of the field. A key challenge arising in this problem is the requirement that neither drilling nor oil production can be done at wells within a specified neighborhood of a well being fractured. We propose a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for determining a schedule for drilling and fracturing wells in an unconventional oil field. We also derive an alternative formulation which provides stronger relaxations. In order to apply the MILP model for scheduling large fields, we derive a rolling horizon approach that solves a sequence of coarse time-scale MILP instances to obtain a solution at the daily time scale.},

	title = {Integer {Programming} {Approaches} {To} {Subspace} {Clustering} {With} {Missing} {Data}},
	language = {en},
	abstract={In the Subspace Clustering with Missing Data problem, we are given a collection of n
	data points, and each of the data points is observed
	only on a subset of its coordinates. The data points are assumed to be concentrated near a union
	of low-dimensional subspaces. The goal is to cluster the vectors as per their subspace membership.
	State-of-the-art algorithms can perform poorly on instances with a large amount of missing data o
	if the data matrix is nearly full-rank.
	We propose a novel integer programming-based method for SCMD. The approach is based on dynamically
	determining a set of candidate subspaces and optimally assigning points to selected subspaces. The
	problem structure is identical to the classical facility-location problem, with subspaces playing
	the role of facilities and data points that of customers. We propose a column-generation approach
	for identifying candidate subspaces combined with a Benders decomposition approach for solving
	the linear programming relaxation of the formulation. An empirical study demonstrates that the
	proposed approach can achieve better clustering accuracy than state-of-the-art methods when the
	data is high-rank or the percentage of missing data is high.},
