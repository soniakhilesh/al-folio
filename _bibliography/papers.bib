	@Comment abstract = {The scheduling of drilling and hydraulic fracturing of wells in an unconventional oil field plays an important role in the profitability of the field. A key challenge arising in this problem is the requirement that neither drilling nor oil production can be done at wells within a specified neighborhood of a well being fractured. We propose a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for determining a schedule for drilling and fracturing wells in an unconventional oil field. We also derive an alternative formulation which provides stronger relaxations. In order to apply the MILP model for scheduling large fields, we derive a rolling horizon approach that solves a sequence of coarse time-scale MILP instances to obtain a solution at the daily time scale. We benchmark our MILP-based rolling horizon approach against a baseline scheduling algorithm in which wells are developed in the order of their discounted production revenue. Our experiments on synthetically generated instances demonstrate that our MILP-based rolling horizon approach can improve profitability of a field by 4–6\%.},

	@Comment abstract = {In the Subspace Clustering with Missing Data (SCMD) problem, we are given a collection of n data points, arranged into columns of a matrix X ∈ Rd×n, and each of the data points is observed only on a subset of its coordinates. The data points are assumed to be concentrated near a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The goal of SCMD is to cluster the vectors of the data matrix X as per their subspace membership. State-of-the-art algorithms for SCMD can perform poorly on instances with a large amount of missing data or if the data matrix X is nearly full-rank. We propose a novel integer programming-based method for SCMD. The approach is based on dynamically determining a set of candidate subspaces and optimally assigning points to selected subspaces. The problem structure is identical to the classical facility-location problem, with subspaces playing the role of facilities and data points that of customers. We propose a column-generation approach for identifying candidate subspaces combined with a Benders decomposition approach for solving the linear programming relaxation of the formulation. An empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach can achieve better clustering accuracy than state-of-the-art methods when the data is high-rank or the percentage of missing data is high.},
